# Image Gallery Application

## Description
This application is an interactive photo gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to upload images from their device, browse the available images, delete them, and maintain the gallery persistently by using Local Storage.

## Features
1. **Upload Images:** Users can upload images from their device. These images are dynamically added to the gallery.
2. **View Gallery:** Uploaded images are displayed in an organized gallery.
3. **Navigate Through Images:** Users can select individual images and navigate forward or backward in the gallery.
4. **Delete Images:** Selected images can be removed from both the gallery and local storage.
5. **Persistence:** By using Local Storage, images remain available even after reloading the page or closing the browser.
6. **Main Menu Interface:** A menu provides easy access to either upload new images or view the gallery.

## How to Use
1. **Open the application:** Click the link provided on GitHub Pages. The application must be run on a server to function correctly.
2. **Upload images:** Click the "Upload File" button and select images from the folder testImages available on the GitHub Project or from your own device. 
3. **Explore the gallery:** Click "Open Gallery" to view uploaded images.
4. **Navigate:** Use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to move through the images.
5. **Delete:** Select an image and click "Delete Image" to remove it from the gallery.
6. **Return to the main menu:** Click "Back to Home" to go back to the main menu.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For content structure.
- **CSS3:** For design and styling.
- **JavaScript:** For DOM manipulation, event handling, and interaction with Local Storage.

## Technical Notes
- Images are stored in Local Storage as Base64 strings.
- The gallery uses dynamic DOM manipulation to add, display, and delete images.

## Known Limitations
1. **Local Storage Size:** Browsers have a storage limit (approximately 5 MB).
2. **Compatibility:** Requires a modern browser supporting HTML5, CSS3, and ES6 JavaScript.
3. **Security:** Since images are stored locally, they are not protected against access if the device is shared.
4. **Errors:** If too many images are uploaded, the app tends to fail at correctly deleting the images and consistently maintaining the information uploaded.
